I am Ziyi Guan (管子义), a third-year PhD candidate at The Univerisity of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Dr. Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/) and [Prof. Graziano Chesi](https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/chesi/). I am expected to graduate from The University of Hong Kong (HKU) in September 2025. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from the School of Microelectronics at the Southern University of Science and Technology in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Hao Yu](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/yuhao.html). 

My major research interests lie in Large Language Model (LLM) compression techniques such as weight Quantization and Pruning. Also, I'm interested in LLM finetune techniques. You can find my publication from my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TtFFJL8AAAAJ&hl=en)

<span style="color: red;">I am actively seeking job opportunities starting in Fall 2025 in the field of Large Language Models (LLM), particularly in model optimization, pruning, quantization, and hardware-efficient neural network design. If you have a relevant position or collaboration opportunity, please feel free to contact me.</span>
